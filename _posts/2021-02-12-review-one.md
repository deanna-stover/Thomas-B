Navigating The Green Book is an interactive travel and vacation guide with a map of the United States that allows you to plan a route and check out all of the previous data that has been found. The interactive map of the U.S. has over 796 different public addresses that include hotels, restaurants, bars, and gas stations. This project provides a great example of how African Americans had to travel in the mid 1950s to avoid confrontation. The first Green Book was published in 1936 and has data from places in Northern California to Texas, Southern Florida to Maine, and everywhere in between. This project by Brian Foo, allows us to understand the struggles that African Americans faced when it came to traveling domestically.

The Green Book is a phenomenal cite full of information. It not only allows you to look at the data in the guides that were originally published, but also allows you to take a look at what public areas were African American friendly. I think this project is a very informative site that can really appeal to not just students and teachers, but also to kids because it has some pretty fun features to play around with! 

Navigating the Green Book is a digital humanities project because this cite allows for great public interaction, with the many different data sets that exist. These virtual addresses give the reader a great footprint as to where many of these establishments were.

One of the coolest things that Brian Foo and is team implemented was the “Map a Trip” feature. To begin, the map of the U.S. is zoomed out to start, but as you click on the certain regions with a number inside of it. You will soon find out that you will discover smaller regions inside of your chosen destination. I can switch between a cluster view and a heatmap view, while also being able to switch the year from 1947 to 1956.
 

If you decide to create a trip, it will automatically try to find food every 250 miles and lodging every 750 miles. As you can see, above I have created a trip from Los Angeles, California to Newport News, Virginia in 1947.
The project is supported by The New York Public Library (NYPL) and is backed by the twenty-one different volumes of The Green Book that have been uploaded to the NYPL digital collection.

One thing that I do wish Brian Foo added was a picture of the establishment after you click on it in the map. Although, it does bring you to [an original photo of the index inside the actual Green Book itself.](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/2d7dd5a0-892b-0132-b80c-58d385a7bbd0) It would also be nice if you could get a street view of the establishment when zooming in on the U.S. Map. I do applaud Brian Foo for allowing the website to be iPhone friendly, which makes it much easier for travel on the go.

Brian Foo and his team did a great job to provide a fun and interactive database for students and teachers. This project was easy to navigate and organized neatly. A quick summary was displayed with important information, that then allowed myself to spend most of the time playing around with the interactive tools that were at my disposal. The formatting and colorway was perfect.
