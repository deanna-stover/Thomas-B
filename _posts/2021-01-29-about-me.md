# About me

### My name is **Thomas Brackett** and I'm in my last semester at Christopher Newport University. I'm currently majoring in Economics with a minor in Military Science. I was born in Bethesda, MD, but moved shortly after to Manassas, VA.

### My family lives in Northern VA, but more specifically **Manassas**. I have a mom and a dad and two siblings. I have an older twin sister named Sandra and a younger brother named Jack. All three of us are in college currently and my parents have been empty nesters for a few years now. Although, we have two dogs that did not go to college named, Pumpkin and Elle. They follow my mom everywhere and keep her good company when we are gone. Below, I have attached a photo with my **twin sister** Sandra and myself. We have always been very close and it's already tough being far away from each other in college.

### The day before I **graduate** as a CNU Captain, I will commission as an Officer in the United States Army. Then, I will head to **Fort Sill, Oklahoma** for some extra schooling for about 6 months. I will then get stationed wherever I'm needed, but I hope it's somewhere exciting like Italy or Germany. I've never been to Europe so that would be a cool experience. I currently have no idea how long I want to stay in, but my ultimate goal is to become the best leader I can be, while maintaining a great relationship with my subordinates. I do have an interest in graduate school whether that be something with economics or even a leadership school. Either way, it is definitely something I want to pursue.

### The reason I got enrolled into the Digital Humanities WI is because it was recommended to me by a friend and I also needed it to fulfill my graduation requirement. I don't think I will pursue a career in writing independetly, but I definitely will need to use writing when I'm in the Army. I'm very excited for what I have learned so far in this class and can't wait for what is to come. It is a little nerve racking using github, but I'm trying my best to get the hang of it. I can't wait to learn more about Digital Humanities and how I can use it in my daily life.
