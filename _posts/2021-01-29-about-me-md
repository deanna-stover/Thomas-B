...and I'm in my last semester at Christopher Newport University. I'm currently majoring in Economics with a minor in Military Science.
###Life After College
The day before I graduate as a CNU Captain, I will commission as an Officer in the United States Army. Then, I will head to **Fort Sill, Oklahoma** for some extra schooling for about 6 months. I will then get stationed wherever I'm needed, but I hope it's somewhere exciting like Italy or Germany. I've never been to Europe so that would be a cool experience. I currently have no idea how long I want to stay in, but my ultimate goal is to become the best leader I can be, while maintaining a great relationship with my subordinates.
###My Family
My family lives in Northern VA, but more specifically **Manassas.** I have a mom and a dad and two siblings. I have an older **twin sister** named Sandra and a younger brother named Jack. All three of us are in college currently and my parents have been empty nesters have a few years now. Although, we have two dogs that did not go to college named, Pumpkin and Elle. They follow my mom everywhere and keep her good company when we are gone.
